# Eye Diagnostic System - EyeSee

A one-stop eye disease solution!

## Introduction

This project is made using Flutter, Python and Tensorflow 2.0

Eyes are a window to one’s soul – and one’s medical health. This study targets the development of an intelligent mobile-based automatic diagnosis integrated with a microscopic lens to identify retinal diseases at initial stage at any time or place. The eye is usually the first visible organ to show symptoms of any diseases of deficiencies. We aim to make an application that allows people at home to simply point their camera to their eye and get a medical diagnosis of the possible health issues that they may be incurring. Using image processing and artificial intelligence, our application will deconstruct every portion of the eyes – from the pupil to the iris and tear duct – to come up with a medical diagnosis for the user. This will allow users, especially with low income, to save money on expensive tests and hospital visits for possible disease diagnosis.
